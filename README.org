* Entipe
Entipe tries to provide entity persistence for web applications.
Unlike other approaches it concentrates on entities.  Entities are
defined by a database schema.  A web application can read and write
entities and their attributes but can not define new entities or
modify the database schema.

** Development Setup CGI
The development configuration is insecure, because all files are in
the document root of the web server.  This means that files are
publicly accessible though the web server.  The setup is intended only
for development using only public data.

The following configuration has been tested with Debian 8.2.

: sudo mkdir /var/www/entipe
: sudo chown $(id -u).$(id -g) /var/www/entipe
: git clone https://github.com/ceving/entipe.git /var/www/entipe
: sudo ln -s /var/www/entipe/demo.site /etc/apache2/sites-available/entipe.conf
: sudo a2ensite entipe
: sudo service apache2 reload

Next the demo can be accessed via http://localhost/demo.html.
